Genesis Provenance is an AI-powered provenance vault designed to combat the $4.5 trillion counterfeit goods crisis. Our platform provides enterprise-grade authentication and documentation for luxury assets including watches, handbags, jewelry, art, collectibles, and luxury vehicles.

We leverage cutting-edge computer vision AI (Google Cloud Vision AI and AWS Rekognition) to authenticate luxury goods with 85-95% confidence, providing forensic-level analysis of materials, craftsmanship, serial numbers, and brand markers. Our hybrid multi-provider AI architecture ensures the highest accuracy by cross-referencing multiple AI engines.

Genesis Provenance serves three primary markets:
1. **Collectors**: Individual luxury asset owners who need secure, AI-verified provenance documentation
2. **Dealers/Resellers**: Businesses requiring bulk authentication and certification for inventory management
3. **Partners**: Insurance companies, auction houses, and authentication services integrating our API

Our platform is built on a modern tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma) and is already deployed at genesisprovenance.abacusai.app with a fully functional subscription model powered by Stripe.

**AWS Services We Use:**
- AWS Rekognition for counterfeit detection and image analysis
- AWS S3 for secure, scalable storage of high-resolution asset images and documents
- AWS Lambda (planned) for serverless AI processing
- AWS RDS (planned migration from current Postgres)

We're currently in the growth phase, having completed Phase 5 of development with active subscriptions (Collector, Dealer, Enterprise tiers). Our roadmap includes expanding AI capabilities, VIN lookup integration for luxury cars, and predictive analytics for asset valuation.
