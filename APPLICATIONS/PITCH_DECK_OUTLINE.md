## Slide 1: COVER

**Visual:** 
- Genesis Provenance logo
- Subtle luxury item collage background (watch, handbag, car)
- Clean, premium aesthetic

**Text:**
```
Genesis Provenance
AI-Powered Authentication for Luxury Assets

[Your Name], CEO

```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Hi, I'm [Name], CEO of Genesis Provenance. We're solving the $4.5 trillion counterfeit luxury goods problem with AI."

## Slide 2: THE PROBLEM

**Visual:**
- Split screen: Authentic vs. Counterfeit Rolex (visually identical)
- Stat overlays with icons

**Text:**
```
The $4.5 Trillion Counterfeit Crisis

• 1 in 3 luxury items sold online is counterfeit
• "Superfakes" fool even 20-year expert authenticators
• Traditional authentication: Slow (1-7 days), Expensive ($50-200), Inconsistent (70-85% accuracy)
• $330B luxury market + $65-100B resale market at risk
```

**Visual Stats:**
- 💵 $4.5T counterfeit market
- ⏱️ 1-7 days wait time
- 💰 $50-200 per item
- ⚠️ 15-30% error rate

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is a genuine Rolex next to a superfake. Even experts can't tell them apart without hours of analysis. One fake sale can destroy a dealer's reputation and expose them to legal liability. The problem is getting worse as counterfeiters adopt AI."

## Slide 3: THE SOLUTION

**Visual:**
- Product screenshot montage: Upload → AI Analysis → Report
- Clean UI highlights

**Text:**
```
AI-Powered Multi-Provider Authentication

```

**Speaker Notes:**
"We built the first multi-provider AI authentication platform. Users upload 1-3 photos, our system sends them to Google Vision AI and AWS Rekognition in parallel, then aggregates results through our custom ML models trained on category-specific patterns. Result: 99.3% accuracy in 2-5 minutes at a fraction of traditional cost."

## Slide 4: HOW IT WORKS (Demo)

**Visual:**
- Video or animated walkthrough (30-45 seconds)
- OR: 4-panel screenshot flow

**Demo Flow:**
1. **Panel 1:** User dashboard with "Add New Asset" button
2. **Panel 2:** Photo upload interface (showing 3 watch photos)
3. **Panel 3:** "AI Analysis in Progress..." with animated loading
4. **Panel 4:** Detailed report:
   - Confidence Score: 98.7%
   - Fraud Risk: LOW
   - Findings: "Serial number format validated", "Engraving depth consistent with authentic"
   - Certificate generated with QR code

**Text:**
```
1. Upload 1-3 photos
2. AI analyzes in real-time (2-5 minutes)
3. Receive detailed authentication report
4. Generate certificate for resale
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's how it works in practice. A dealer uploads photos of a Rolex. Our AI runs multiple analysis pipelines simultaneously. In under 3 minutes, they get a detailed report with a confidence score, risk assessment, and specific findings. They can then generate a certificate with a QR code that buyers can verify. The entire process that used to take days now takes minutes."

🌍 Global expansion opportunity
📊 Online luxury sales accelerating post-COVID
```

**Breakdown:**
- **Primary market:** Luxury goods dealers
- **Secondary market:** Individual collectors
- **Tertiary markets:** Insurance, legal, auction houses, marketplaces

**Speaker Notes:**
"The luxury goods market is $330 billion globally. The resale market is $65-100 billion and doubling by 2030. Every single transaction in this market needs authentication. We're targeting $1.6 billion in annual revenue at just 1% market penetration. And this is before we expand to adjacent markets like insurance claims, legal proceedings, and customs enforcement."

## Slide 6: BUSINESS MODEL

**Visual:**
- Three-tier comparison table
- Price anchoring visualization

**Text:**
```
SaaS Subscription Model

 COLLECTOR       DEALER        ENTERPRISE
   $49/mo        $499/mo         $2,999/mo
   10 analyses   100 analyses    Unlimited
   Individuals   Resellers       Auction houses

📈 Revenue Streams:
• Recurring subscriptions (primary)
• Per-analysis overages
• Enterprise custom pricing
• API access fees

💰 Unit Economics:
• LTV:CAC = 15:1
• Gross Margin = 85%
• Payback = 4 months
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"We run a classic SaaS subscription model with three tiers. Individual collectors pay $49/month for 10 authentications. Dealers pay $499/month for 100. Enterprise customers like auction houses get unlimited for $2,999. Our unit economics are outstanding: 15:1 LTV to CAC ratio, 85% gross margins, 4-month payback period. This is because our marginal cost per authentication is near zero - it's just API calls."

Competitive Landscape

              High Accuracy
                   ^
                   |
   Traditional --> * Genesis Provenance
   Services        |
                   |  * Entrupy (single-provider)
                   |
   LegitGrails <---+---> Fast
   (Basic AI)      |
                   |
             Low Accuracy

Our Advantages:
✓ Multi-provider AI (only one)
✓ Category-specific ML models
✓ 99.3% accuracy in 2-5 minutes
✓ API-first for platform integrations
✓ Proprietary counterfeit database
```

**Competitor Breakdown:**
- **Entrupy:** Single-provider, hardware-dependent
- **Real Authentication:** Human experts, slow, expensive
- **LegitApp/LegitGrails:** Basic AI, lower-value items

**Speaker Notes:**
"There are a few players in this space, but no one has our combination of speed and accuracy. Entrupy uses proprietary hardware and a single AI provider. Real Authentication uses human experts - slow and expensive. LegitApp focuses on sneakers, not high-value luxury. We're the only platform combining multiple commercial AI providers with category-specific machine learning. This gives us both the highest accuracy and fastest turnaround."

Defensible Technology Moat

1️⃣ Multi-Provider Architecture
   → First-mover in hybrid AI authentication
   → Redundancy and cross-validation

2️⃣ Proprietary Datasets
   → [X] authenticated + counterfeit patterns
   → Growing with every analysis

3️⃣ Category-Specific ML Models
   → Brand-level pattern recognition
   → Serial number validation algorithms

4️⃣ Network Effects
   → More dealers → More trust → More collectors

5️⃣ IP Strategy
   → Patent pending: Multi-provider orchestration
   → Trade secrets: ML model architectures
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our moat is multi-layered. First, we have a first-mover advantage in hybrid AI authentication - no one else combines multiple commercial AI providers. Second, our dataset grows with every authentication, creating a compounding data advantage. Third, our category-specific models require deep domain expertise that takes years to build. Fourth, we have network effects - when dealers trust us, collectors trust those dealers. Finally, we have patent-pending IP on our multi-provider orchestration system."

• International expansion
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Current CAC: $200
- Target: $150 with scale
- Channels: Organic search (40%), Referrals (30%), Direct sales (30%)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our go-to-market is phased and capital-efficient. Phase 1 is direct B2B sales to dealers - we're executing this now with $200 CAC and 4-month payback. Phase 2 is platform partnerships - we're in talks with major auction houses and marketplaces for API integrations. This will 10x our volume. Phase 3 is enterprise sales to luxury brands themselves, plus government contracts for customs and law enforcement. Each phase builds on the previous one's network effects."

- Bar graph with growth trajectory

**Text:**
```
Strong Unit Economics & Clear Path to Profitability

     Year 1      Year 2       Year 3
Rev:  $300K     $3M          $10M
GM:   85%       85%          85%
Net:  -$50K     $500K        $3M

Customers:    500     →    3,000    →   5,000
ARPU:         $50     →    $83      →   $167
CAC:          $200    →    $150     →   $120
LTV:          $3,000  →    $5,000   →   $7,000

Key Assumptions:
• 25% MoM growth Year 1, 15% MoM Year 2
• ARPU increases as customers upgrade tiers
• CAC decreases with brand and referrals
• 85% gross margins (API costs only)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our unit economics are incredibly strong. We're projecting $300K ARR in Year 1, growing to $10M by Year 3. Our gross margins are 85% because our marginal cost is just AI API calls - no physical goods, no human labor at scale. We'll be profitable by mid-Year 2. These projections assume conservative 25% monthly growth in Year 1, tapering to 15% in Year 2. The key driver is our LTV to CAC ratio improving from 15:1 to 58:1 as we scale."
