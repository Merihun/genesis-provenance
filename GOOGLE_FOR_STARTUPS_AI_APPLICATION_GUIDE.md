### Step 5: AI/ML Use Case Details
**Time**: 20-25 minutes

This is the **most important section** for Google for Startups AI.

#### **Primary AI/ML Use Case**
Select: **Computer Vision**

#### **Detailed AI Use Case Description**

**Question**: "How does your product use AI/ML?"

**Sample Answer** (copy and customize):

```
**Problem We're Solving with AI:**
The luxury goods market loses $4.5 trillion annually to counterfeits. Traditional authentication methods (manual inspection by experts) are:
- Slow (days to weeks per item)
- Expensive ($50-$500 per authentication)
- Not scalable (limited expert availability)
- Subjective (human error rates 10-15%)

**Our AI Solution:**
Genesis Provenance uses Google Cloud Vision AI to provide instant, scalable, and objective authentication with 85-95% accuracy.

**Technical Implementation:**

1. **Image Upload & Preprocessing**
   - Users upload 1-3 high-resolution photos of luxury assets
   - Sharp.js preprocesses images: resize to 2048px, enhance contrast, sharpen details
   - Images stored temporarily in memory (no local storage)

2. **Google Cloud Vision AI API Calls** (Current Implementation)
   We make parallel API calls to:
   
   a) **Label Detection API**
      - Identifies materials: "leather", "gold", "diamonds", "stainless steel"
      - Detects craftsmanship markers: "precision", "hand-stitched", "polished"
      - Returns confidence scores (0-100%) for each label
   
   b) **Text Detection (OCR) API**
      - Extracts serial numbers, reference numbers, brand text
      - Validates against known brand formats (e.g., Rolex serial: 6-8 alphanumeric)
      - Detects counterfeit indicators: font inconsistencies, spelling errors
   
   c) **Logo Detection API**
      - Identifies brand logos and their positions
      - Measures logo quality and precision
      - Compares against authentic brand logo database
   
   d) **Image Properties API**
      - Analyzes color profiles (authentic vs. counterfeit color variations)
      - Detects image manipulation or low-quality reproductions
      - Assesses lighting and clarity for analysis reliability

3. **Custom ML Layer** (Post-Processing)
   After receiving Google Vision AI results, our custom algorithms:
   - Apply category-specific weights (watches prioritize serial numbers, cars prioritize VIN)
   - Cross-reference brand patterns (e.g., Louis Vuitton date codes, Ferrari chassis numbers)
   - Calculate composite confidence score (0-100%)
   - Assign fraud risk level: LOW (90-100%), MEDIUM (70-89%), HIGH (50-69%), CRITICAL (<50%)

4. **Multi-Provider Validation** (Optional)
   - For HIGH/CRITICAL risk items, we cross-validate with AWS Rekognition
   - Compare results from both providers
   - Flag discrepancies for human expert review

5. **Results & Reporting**
   - Generate detailed authentication report (PDF certificate)
   - Include:
     * Confidence score with visual progress bar
     * Fraud risk assessment with color-coded badge
     * Authenticity markers found (e.g., "Genuine leather grain pattern detected")
     * Counterfeit indicators (e.g., "Serial number format does not match Rolex standard")
     * AI provider used (Google Cloud Vision AI)
     * Timestamp and unique certificate ID
   - Store results in PostgreSQL database
   - Create provenance event log entry

**Current Performance Metrics:**
- Average processing time: 3-5 seconds per asset

### Step 9: Additional Questions (Google-Specific)
**Time**: 5-10 minutes

#### **Why Google Cloud over competitors?**

**Sample Answer**:
```
We chose Google Cloud Vision AI as our primary AI provider for three key reasons:

1. **Superior OCR Accuracy**: Google Vision's text detection API outperforms competitors for luxury goods with complex fonts, engravings, and small serial numbers. Our testing showed 15-20% higher accuracy vs. AWS Rekognition for watch dial text.

2. **Logo Detection**: Google's logo recognition database includes 100,000+ brands, covering most luxury manufacturers. Critical for automated brand identification.

3. **Unified AI Platform**: Google's ecosystem (Vision AI → Vertex AI → BigQuery ML) allows seamless progression from API-based inference to custom model training to predictive analytics—all within one platform.

4. **Cost Efficiency**: Google Vision API pricing ($1.50/1000 images for first 1M) is 20-30% more cost-effective than competitors for our high-volume use case.

5. **Technical Superiority**: Google's AI models are trained on larger, more diverse datasets, resulting in better generalization for luxury goods across categories (watches, cars, jewelry, art).

Long-term, we plan to migrate our entire infrastructure to Google Cloud (Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Run) for unified billing, monitoring, and support.
```

#### **How will GCP credits accelerate growth?**

**Sample Answer**:
```
$350K in GCP credits will accelerate Genesis Provenance's growth in three critical areas:

1. **Scale AI Volume (0-6 months)**
   - Increase from 500 to 10,000 monthly AI analyses
   - Credits cover ~$60K in Vision API costs
   - Enables aggressive customer acquisition without AI cost constraints
   - Target: 500+ paying customers by month 6

2. **Build Custom ML Models (6-12 months)**
   - Train Vertex AI models for category-specific authentication
   - Credits cover ~$80K in training and inference costs
   - Improve accuracy from 85-95% to 95-98%
   - Launch "Premium AI" tier for high-value assets ($10K+)

3. **Launch Partner API (9-12 months)**
   - Migrate to Cloud Run for real-time API (<500ms response)
   - Credits cover ~$40K in compute and storage costs
   - Onboard 10+ dealer/auction house partners
   - Process 50,000+ monthly authentications via API

**Financial Impact:**
Without GCP credits, AI costs would be our #1 expense ($6-$12K/month), limiting growth to ~10-20% MoM. With credits, we can achieve 50-100% MoM growth for 12-18 months, reaching $100K MRR by end of Year 1.

**After Credits:**
By month 12-18, we'll be generating sufficient revenue ($50K-$100K MRR) to transition to pay-as-you-go GCP billing, making us a long-term Google Cloud customer with projected $150K-$300K annual spend.
