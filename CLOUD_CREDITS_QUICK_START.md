## 💰 Financial Impact

### Without Cloud Credits
**Monthly AI Costs (at scale)**:
- Google Vision AI: 5,000 analyses × $0.006 = $30/month
- AWS Rekognition: 5,000 analyses × $0.001 = $5/month
- Storage (S3): $50/month
- Compute (Lambda): $100/month
- Database (RDS): $150/month
- **Total**: ~$335/month = **$4,020/year**

At higher scale (50,000 monthly analyses):
- AI costs alone: $300-$500/month = **$3,600-$6,000/year**

### With $450K in Cloud Credits (AWS + Google)
- **Covers 18-24 months** of all infrastructure costs
- **Allows aggressive scaling** without cost constraints
- **Enables experimentation** with Vertex AI, SageMaker, BigQuery ML
- **Cash preservation**: $4K-$6K/year saved = more runway

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
1. Apply for lowest tier "to be safe" → Apply for highest tier you qualify for
2. Generic company description → Use AI-focused, detailed descriptions from guides
3. Vague use case → Be specific about APIs, services, and costs
4. Skip pitch deck → It significantly increases approval chances
5. Use personal email → Use business email (admin@genesisprovenance.com)
6. Leave funding blank if you have any → Even $5K angel investment helps
7. Underestimate usage → Project 12-month spend at $15K-$150K

### ✅ DO:
1. Apply for both AWS and Google simultaneously
2. Use pre-written content from guides (save 80% of time)
3. Mention existing usage (S3, Rekognition, Google Vision AI)
4. Emphasize AI/ML capabilities
5. Show product is live and generating revenue (if applicable)
6. Respond quickly if additional info requested (within 5-7 days)
7. Track application status weekly
